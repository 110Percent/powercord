# aethcord
A Discord client mod tailored to me.

Aethcord is *not* meant to be used by everyone. It's pretty much unconfigurable; everything is exactly the way **I** like it.  
If you for some reason want to use this anyways:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aetheryx/aethcord
cd aethcord
npm i --only=production
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh # follow instructions
# fully reboot Discord client (no ctrl+r) and you're good
```  

Said script isn't going to work on Windows, but if anyone feels up to it, feel free to PR a batch script / fixes needed for Windows.  
Adittionally, feel free to use and adapt the project to your own personal liking, or ask any questions [here](https://discord.gg/Yphr6WG).
